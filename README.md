# Electricity Production Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on assessing and ranking countries based on their electricity production volume. The analysis involves clustering (hierarchical methods), linear ordering (Hellwig's method) and other statistical techniques to gain insights into the production patterns.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Preparation:** Gather data on energy production.

2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's suitable for analysis.

3. **Analysis Techniques:**
   - **Clustering:** Identify groups of countries with similar electricity production characteristics.
   - **Linear Ordering:** Establish a linear order of countries based on the Hellwig's method (Pattern of Development).

4. **Insights and Visualizations:** Interpret the results and create visualizations to provide a better understanding of the analysis.
